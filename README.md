Do you develop Android apps? Are you wondering how to get started or wondering how to improve? This series of courses covers the essentials you must know to develop, design, and manage a native Android application. In this course, the fourth part in a four-part series, instructor Annyce Davis focuses on data, with hands-on challenges to check your understanding. Annyce explains the various types of data processing available in Android. She shows you how to package static data in JSON files, to make it easier to work with data in your application. Annyce steps through using LiveData objects, HTTP clients, a Retrofit interface, and more to get data from a web service. She discusses how you can use a RecyclerView to display different types of data in your app, then concludes by walking you through ways to display data that a user selects.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
